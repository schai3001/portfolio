# Projects

## so_long
A 2D game in C where the player collects items and reaches the exit
- Player navigates maps, collects items and reaches exit to win
- Animated sprites for player and collectibles
- Real-time movement counter and collision detection
- Map validation ensures all items are reachable using flood-fill algorithm



## philosophers
A multithreaded C program solving the classic dining philosophers problem using pthreads and mutexes.
- Multithreading with pthreads (thread creation, synchronization, joining)
- Mutex programming for race condition prevention and resource protection
- Concurrent programming patterns and thread-safe data access
- Process synchronization and inter-thread communication



## minishell
Creation of a shell terminal in C with simple built-in and features
- Complete shell Unix development
- Built-in programming (cd, echo, pwd, export, etc.)
- Files descriptors, memory and signal management



## cube3D
A 3D first-person game engine built in C using raycasting techniques, inspired by classic games like Wolfenstein 3D.
- Renders 3D environments from 2D maps using raycasting algorithms
- Real-time player movement with WASD controls and mouse look
- Texture mapping and Minimap display
- Map parsing with validation



## ft_transcendance
